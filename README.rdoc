= About

Textile.Co bought a punch card machine that can send a HTTP's JSON POST payloads to a
server and wants to use it to track arrivals and departures of employees. Working hours for
employees are from 9 am to 6 pm, Monday to Friday.

The customer wants you to implement the following features:

1. Your customer wants to be able to see which employees are arriving late.

2. Your customer wants to know which employees are not coming to work at all.

3. Your customerâ€™s employees are complaining that the reported hours for a given period
are wrong, so your customer wants to give each of his employees the opportunity to
review their current period working hours report 3 days before the paycheck day.

The JSON must be sent to localhost:3000/checkpoints for the creation of the checkpoint with the user's barcode.

*Three-point estimation for each feature*
1. Your customer wants to be able to see which employees are arriving late.
a = 60 minutes
m = 80 minutes
c = 100 minutes

2. Your customer wants to know which employees are not coming to work at all.
a = 40 minutes
b = 60 minutes
c = 80 minutes

3. Your customer wants to give each of his employees the opportunity to review their current period working hours report 3 days before the paycheck.
a = 30 minutes
b = 40 minutes
c = 60 minutes
